# Stokes Flow Simulation

This is a web app that simulates the fluid flow around a falling sphere, taking into account the dynamic effects of fluid viscosity, sphere radius and density, along with static parameters such as gravity, buoyancy and drag.

The simulation measures the time taken for the sphere to travel 15cm at terminal velocity. It is meant as a lab auxiliary for the Chemical Engineering course at the University of Birmingham.
